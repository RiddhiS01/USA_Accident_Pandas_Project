This project provides an in-depth analysis of the USA accident data set for the year 2022-23 and perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on various variables provided and provides clear visuals to understand the current state of the data. The project sheds light on the road accident data of the American states. The analysis is conducted to identify the top cities and states that recorded the most accidents, the dangerous hours, weather conditions etc. We have also included statistical analysis by conducting hypothesis testing to find out details about certain variables and how they interact together. Utilized Python libraries like pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy within Jupyter Notebook environment.

The project contains the following sections:
1. Data Pre-processing
2. Descriptive Statistics
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Hypothesis Testing
5. Conclusion and Solutions
