# USA_Accident_Pandas_Project
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the USA accident data set for the year 2022-23 and perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on various variables provided and provides clear visuals to understand the current state of the data. Moreover, this project also includes testing of hypotheses and a machine learning model that predicts the severity of traffic accidents based on various contributing factors such as weather conditions, road features, and time of occurrence. Leveraging a dataset of historical accident records, the project utilizes regression algorithms to analyze patterns and identify key predictors of accident severity.
